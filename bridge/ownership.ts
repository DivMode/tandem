/**
 * ownership.ts — provenance for restart adoption (Phase 2 binding correction A).
 *
 * An `@tandem_engine` tmux tag ALONE is not enough to prove a tmux session was
 * created by THIS Tandem installation: anyone on the same OS user account could
 * hand-create a session named "ccm-<name>" with a matching tag and have it
 * silently adopted as drivable on the next bridge restart. We ALSO tag every
 * spawned session with a durable, installation-local, random owner id and
 * require an EXACT match on both tags before adoption.
 *
 * TRUST MODEL: this is a same-OS-user trust boundary. The owner id is a
 * durable PROVENANCE MARKER — proof "this Tandem process (or an earlier run of
 * it) created this session" — not a claim of isolation from other processes
 * running as the same OS user. Anything running as that same user can already
 * read the owner-id file; the goal is to stop accidental/incidental adoption of
 * a same-named tmux session that Tandem did not create, not to defend against a
 * hostile co-tenant on the same account.
 *
 * The id is never logged and never returned to a caller — it exists only to be
 * written into a tmux session's user option and compared against on adoption.
