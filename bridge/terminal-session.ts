/**
 * terminal-session.ts — drive a REAL interactive engine TUI (or shell) inside
 * tmux, parameterized by an EngineDescriptor (./drivable.ts). Phase 1 only used
 * this for `claude`; Phase 2 generalizes it so `codex` and `shell` reuse the
 * SAME tmux lifecycle — spawn, warmup/readiness, injection, idle detection,
 * interrupt, close — with zero per-engine duplication of that lifecycle.
 *
 * BILLING (see spec §1b): for `claude` we manipulate the owner's real
 * interactive TUI via terminal keystrokes — NOT `claude -p` / headless — so
 * usage stays on their subscription windows. The bridge SPAWNS a fresh
 * interactive process inside a tmux session ("tmux new-session -d -s ccm-<name>
 * <engine>") and drives it by injecting keys + scraping the pane. The owner can
 * "tmux attach -t ccm-<name>" to watch or type alongside.
 *
 * IDLE DETECTION — marker-based (claude) vs markerless (codex/shell):
 *   Claude has a proven footer marker: "esc to interrupt" PRESENT means working;
 *   ABSENT plus N stable polls means idle (see EngineDescriptor.isWorking).
 *   Codex/shell have no invented marker (binding — Phase 2 correction B: a
 *   guessed marker risks FALSE completion the moment the real UI text changes).
 *   Their idle/ready state is decided ENTIRELY by pane-stability: the pane must
 *   be byte-stable for >= descriptor.minStableMs before a turn/warmup counts as
 *   done/ready (see stepStability below). Both paths share one state machine so
 *   "changing output is working" holds uniformly, marker or not.
 *
 * INJECTION SAFETY: text is injected with
 *   tmux send-keys -t <tgt> -l -- <text>     (literal; -- ends option parsing)
 * then a SEPARATE
 *   tmux send-keys -t <tgt> Enter
 * The user's text is passed as an execFile argv element, never interpolated into
 * a shell string, so it can never be reinterpreted as tmux key names or shell
 * metacharacters. NOTE: for the `shell` engine, the whole POINT of send() is
 * that the injected text is executed AS a shell command by the pane's real
 * shell once it hits Enter — that is the feature (arbitrary OS-user command
 * execution beginning in the allowlisted cwd), not a vulnerability of this
 * file. The cwd admission check is not an OS sandbox.
 *
 * PROVENANCE (binding — Phase 2 correction A, see ./ownership.ts): every
 * spawned session is tagged with tmux user options `@tandem_engine` (which
 * descriptor spawned it) and `@tandem_owner` (this installation's durable
 * random owner id). attachExisting() refuses to adopt a same-named session
 * unless BOTH tags match exactly — an `@tandem_engine` tag alone is not proof
 * Tandem created the session.
 *
 * TRANSCRIPT + CURSOR: on spawn we attach
 *   tmux pipe-pane -o -t <tgt> 'cat >> <transcriptsDir>/<name>.log'
 * The append-only log's byte length is the cursor. readSince(offset) reads from a
 * byte offset and strips ANSI for a human-readable slice.
