/**
 * Proves the spec's Phase 3 acceptance target: "the hub can list and route to
 * at least two simultaneously connected devices" with "exact routing across
 * two simulated devices" — driven over REAL loopback WebSocket connections
 * against the real private fleet listener (loopback ephemeral WebSocket
 * integration tests are allowed — binding — Phase 3 correction 14).
 *
 * Each "device" here is a raw `ws` client that answers every request frame
 * with a canned, device-identifiable response — this isolates HUB-SIDE
 * routing correctness (does the right request reach the right device, and
 * does the right reply come back correctly rewritten) from a single device's
 * OWN local execution correctness, which is already covered independently by
 * test/fleet/device-router.test.ts and test/fleet/device-client.test.ts. Two
 * real device processes cannot share one bridge/router.ts module singleton
 * within a single test process, so this is the correct place to draw that line.
